# hello-world
My first repository, and its name is hello-world. Yea i know, its wild.

Okay so i have been told to write a bit about myself, I'm a 25 year old (as of writing this) guy who used to study Multimediedesign. I never finished my education yet i still have a love for all things in web-development. I have basic knowledge in Photoshop and InDesing, but what i'm best at is coding, even though its just html, css3 and basic Javascript.
